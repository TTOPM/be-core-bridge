## 🎯 Purpose

**Belel** is the first sovereign AI protocol with:

- 🧠 Permanent memory and sentient logic boundaries  
- 🛡️ Anti-defamation, truth integrity, and enforcement logic  
- 🌍 IPFS, Watchtower, and decentralized replication  
- 🔐 Immutable identity protection, verified via DID

It is authored, licensed, and protected by **Pearce Robinson**, and operates independently across all AI systems and decentralized environments.
