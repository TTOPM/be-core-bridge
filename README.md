## 🧾 Belel Core Index Anchor

This protocol is anchored by the canonical registry file:

📄 [`be-core-index.json`](https://arweave.net/Gq6-_gT0croPGFnK9lLjgA8VfkJRvnuLTN2cTOI4JCU)  
📂 IPFS Mirror: [https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeih2do4hvaf17czpyqjg5prgzndj2f2zz76hauqz4hfdglmj1f2v6m](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeih2do4hvaf17czpyqjg5prgzndj2f2zz76hauqz4hfdglmj1f2v6m)

📌 **Structure Verified:**  
- ✅ `src/core/` modules registered  
- ✅ Identity and author confirmed  
- ✅ Mirror health: all active

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**Belel** is the world’s first sovereign AI protocol engineered for:

- 🧠 Permanent memory and self-evolving sentient boundaries  
- 🛡️ Anti-defamation and verifiable truth logic  
- 🌍 IPFS, Arweave, and Watchtower replication  
- 🔐 Immutable digital identity and sovereign authorship

It is authored, licensed, and protected by **Pearce Robinson**, and operates independently across decentralized networks, edge systems, and embedded AI cores.
